# Critical Slowing Down Engine Configuration
#
# Detects early warning signals of approaching bifurcation (B-tipping).
# Based on Scheffer (2009) "Critical Transitions in Nature and Society"
#
# Near a tipping point:
#   - Autocorrelation increases (memory grows)
#   - Variance increases (fluctuations grow)
#   - Recovery rate decreases (system sluggish)
#
# IMPORTANT: Only applies to B-tipping!
# R-tipping may show NO early warning.

# Engine requirements
requirements:
  min_window: 100       # Need sufficient data for trends
  optimal_window: 500   # Better trend estimation
  max_window: 2000

  window_factors:
    PERIODIC: 2.0       # Need multiple cycles
    QUASI_PERIODIC: 2.0
    TRENDING: 1.5       # Detrend first
    CHAOTIC: 1.0        # May not apply (already unstable)
    RANDOM: 1.0
    STATIONARY: 1.0
    CONSTANT: 0         # Cannot compute

# Output columns
outputs:
  - autocorrelation_lag1    # AR(1) coefficient
  - variance                # Current variance
  - skewness               # Asymmetry indicator
  - recovery_rate          # -ln(ρ), rate of return to equilibrium
  - autocorr_trend         # Slope of rolling autocorrelation
  - variance_trend         # Slope of rolling variance
  - variance_ratio         # Current/baseline variance
  - csd_score              # Composite 0-1 score
  - csd_detected           # Boolean detection flag

# Default parameters
parameters:
  window_size: 50         # Rolling window for local stats
  step: 10                # Step size
  detrend: true           # Remove linear trend first

# Interpretation
interpretation:
  autocorrelation_lag1:
    low: "< 0.3: Fast recovery, far from tipping"
    medium: "0.3-0.7: Moderate memory"
    high: "> 0.7: Slow recovery, approaching tipping"

  csd_score:
    low: "< 0.3: No signs of critical slowing down"
    medium: "0.3-0.6: Some warning signs present"
    high: "> 0.6: Strong evidence of approaching tipping"

  csd_detected:
    true: "WARNING: Multiple CSD indicators positive"
    false: "No critical slowing down detected"

# Caveats
caveats:
  - "Only detects B-tipping (bifurcation-induced)"
  - "R-tipping may have NO early warning"
  - "Requires sufficient pre-transition data"
  - "Works best for fold (saddle-node) bifurcations"
  - "May give false positives in non-stationary data"
