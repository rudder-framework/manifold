Manifold Stages — 24 computation stages organized in 5 groups.

Groups:
    vector:      Signal-level features (breaks, signal_vector, signal_stability)
    geometry:    Cohort geometry and structure (cohort_vector, cohort_geometry, signal_geometry, geometry_dynamics)
    dynamics:    Trajectory evolution (FTLE, Lyapunov, velocity fields)
    information: Pairwise relationships (coupling, information flow)
    energy:      Fleet-scale analysis (cross-cohort geometry, causality)
