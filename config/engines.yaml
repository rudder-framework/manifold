# Engine Classification
# =====================
# Engines split by fundamental mathematical nature

pointwise:
  # These produce values at EVERY timestamp
  # No windowing, no information loss

  hilbert:
    description: "Instantaneous amplitude, frequency, phase via Hilbert transform"
    outputs:
      - inst_freq      # Instantaneous frequency
      - inst_amp       # Instantaneous amplitude
      - inst_phase     # Instantaneous phase
    min_samples: 10    # Need enough for transform stability

  derivatives:
    description: "Time derivatives of signal"
    outputs:
      - velocity       # df/dt
      - acceleration   # d²f/dt²
    min_samples: 3     # Need 3 points for second derivative

  statistical:
    description: "Rolling statistics at native resolution"
    outputs:
      - zscore         # (x - μ) / σ using expanding window
      - rolling_std    # Local standard deviation
      - rolling_mean   # Local mean
    min_samples: 10
    window: 10         # Rolling window for local stats


windowed:
  # These REQUIRE multiple samples to compute
  # Output is fundamentally sparse (one value per window)

  entropy:
    description: "Shannon entropy of value distribution"
    outputs:
      - sample_entropy
      - permutation_entropy
      - spectral_entropy
    min_samples: 20
    reason: "Entropy requires distribution estimation"

  hurst:
    description: "Hurst exponent - long-range dependence"
    outputs:
      - hurst_exponent
      - hurst_confidence
    min_samples: 50
    reason: "Needs range of scales for R/S analysis"

  lyapunov:
    description: "Largest Lyapunov exponent - chaos measure"
    outputs:
      - lyapunov_exponent
    min_samples: 100
    reason: "Needs trajectory divergence over time"

  rqa:
    description: "Recurrence Quantification Analysis"
    outputs:
      - recurrence_rate
      - determinism
      - laminarity
      - trapping_time
    min_samples: 50
    reason: "Needs embedded phase space"

  garch:
    description: "Volatility clustering"
    outputs:
      - garch_omega
      - garch_alpha
      - garch_beta
      - conditional_volatility
    min_samples: 30
    reason: "Needs return series for estimation"

  spectral:
    description: "Frequency domain features"
    outputs:
      - dominant_freq
      - spectral_centroid
      - spectral_bandwidth
      - spectral_rolloff
    min_samples: 32
    reason: "FFT needs window for frequency resolution"
