# PRISM Domains Registry
# ======================
# Add new domains here - they'll appear in the interactive picker
#
# Each domain has:
#   description: Human-readable description
#   source: Primary data source (for reference)
#   window_profile: Key in stride.yaml domain_windows (if different from domain name)
#
# Window/stride settings are in config/stride.yaml under domain_windows

domains:
  # Chemical Engineering
  cheme:
    description: "Chemical engineering process data (TEP - 3min sampling)"
    source: "Tennessee Eastman Process"
    # window: 480 samples (24hr), stride: 60 samples (3hr)

  # Aerospace / Prognostics
  cmapss:
    description: "NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation (all FD001-FD004)"
    source: "NASA Prognostics Repository"
    # window: 50 cycles, stride: 5 cycles

  fd001:
    description: "C-MAPSS FD001 - single operating condition, single fault mode"
    source: "NASA Prognostics Repository"
    window_profile: cmapss

    description: "Synthetic dynamical systems (Lorenz, Rossler, etc.)"
    source: "Generated"
    # window: 500 samples, stride: 50 samples

  # Climate
  climate:
    description: "Climate and environmental data (monthly)"
    source: "NOAA, NASA GISS"
    # window: 60 months (5yr), stride: 12 months (1yr)

  # Ecology

    # window: 50 samples, stride: 5 samples

  # Bearing Run-to-Failure
  femto:
    description: "FEMTO bearing run-to-failure (prognostics)"
    source: "FEMTO-ST IEEE PHM Challenge 2012"
    # window: 100 time steps, stride: 10 steps

  # Hydraulic System
  hydraulic:
    description: "UCI Hydraulic system multi-component monitoring"
    source: "UCI ML Repository"
    # window: 200 cycles, stride: 20 cycles

  # Metro Train
  metro:
    description: "MetroPT Porto metro train air production unit"
    source: "UCI ML Repository"
    # window: 3600 samples (1hr), stride: 300 (5min)

  # Generic Bearing (for XJTU-SY)
  bearing:
    description: "Generic bearing run-to-failure datasets"
    source: "Various"
    # window: 100 time steps, stride: 10 steps

# To add a new domain:
# 1. Add entry above with description and source
# 2. Add window config in config/stride.yaml under domain_windows
# 3. Run any entry point - domain directory auto-created
# 4. Use fetcher or load data to data/{domain}/raw/observations.parquet
