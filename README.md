# Manifold

Domain-agnostic dynamical systems computation engine.

**observations.parquet in, geometry parquets out.**

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m manifold ~/domains/rossler/train
```

Point at a directory containing `time_observations.parquet` and `manifest.yaml`. Manifold runs all stages and writes parquet files to `time_output/`.

## What It Does

Manifold reads a manifest (generated by Prime) that specifies which engines to run on which signals with which window sizes. It produces parquet files describing:

- **Signal features** — per-window statistics, entropy, spectral, fractal measures
- **System geometry** — eigendecomposition, effective dimensionality, condition number
- **Dynamics** — FTLE, Lyapunov exponents, velocity fields, thermodynamics
- **Topology** — persistent homology, Betti numbers
- **Pairwise relationships** — correlation, Granger causality, transfer entropy

## Architecture

```
manifold/stages/    Runners — orchestrate I/O, read parquet, call engines, write parquet
manifold/core/      Engines — compute, DataFrames in, DataFrames out, no file I/O
pmtvs (external)    Math — 244 functions, numpy in, number out
```

Each layer only calls the layer below it. Manifold computes. It never classifies, labels, or interprets. That's Prime's job.
