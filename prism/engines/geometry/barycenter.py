PRISM Barycenter Engine
=======================

Conviction-weighted center of mass computation across timescales.

"When five year olds run around - normal noise. When adults start running - regime change."

Core Concept:
    - Short windows (63d/21d) are scouts - noisy, early warning
    - Medium windows (126d) are bridges - confirmation
    - Long windows (252d) are anchors - structural truth

Weights are loaded from config/stride.yaml (default: 21d=0.5, 63d=1.0, 126d=2.0, 252d=4.0)

Computes per signal:
    - barycenter: conviction-weighted center of mass across timescales
    - dispersion: tension between shortest and longest window (scout vs anchor)
    - alignment: coherence across all windows (1 = perfect agreement)

Returns cohort-level aggregates for storage in geometry.cohorts.

Phase: Derived (geometry layer)
Normalization: Z-score preferred
