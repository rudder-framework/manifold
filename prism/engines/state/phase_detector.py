PRISM Phase Detector Engine
===========================

Detects regime transitions and classifies system phases from geometry dynamics.

A regime shift is confirmed when:
1. anchor_ratio > 1.5 (anchors moved more than scouts)
2. regime_conviction is elevated (high energy into tight structure)
3. Multiple confirmation signals align

Phase Classification:
    - accumulation: Low energy, building tension, low conviction
    - expansion: Rising energy, releasing tension, moderate conviction
    - distribution: High energy, high tension, declining conviction
    - contraction: Falling energy, falling tension, high conviction

Input: Energy and tension dynamics
Output: Phase labels, regime shift detection, confidence scores

Usage:
    from prism.engines.phase_detector import PhaseDetectorEngine

    engine = PhaseDetectorEngine()
    result = engine.run(state_df)
